My passion for education and learning makes me an active listener, a curious individual, and inevitably a lifelong learner. I see myself as a self-starter and a driven learner, also enjoying a stimulating conversation, a strongly supported argument. I enjoy the challenge of problem solving, analytical thinking , being an innovative learner, and a versatile athlete. My interests are also hiking, good music, football and most importantly revamping my baking and cooking skills.'
