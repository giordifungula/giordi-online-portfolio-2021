    bio: 'I am passionately interested in Education, People, and Tech. My passion for education and learning makes me an active listener, a curious individual, and inevitably a lifelong learner. I see myself as a self-starter and a driven individual. I also enjoy a stimulating conversation and a strongly supported argument. I enjoy the challenge of problem solving, the building and bringing to life ideas using code. An innovative learner, and a versatile athlete/runner. My interests are also hiking, good music, football and most importantly revamping my baking and cooking skills.'
